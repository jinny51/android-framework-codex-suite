# Android Framework Patch Rules

## Naming

Patch filename pattern:

```text
平台Android版本-模块名@补丁功能名.patch
```

Example:

```text
mtk14-frameworks-base@allow_powerkey_to_user.patch
```

Suggested regex:

```text
^[a-z0-9]+[0-9]+-[A-Za-z0-9._-]+@[a-z0-9_.-]+\.patch$
```

## Required Feature README Headings

Each framework change package must include one feature README with:

```markdown
## 功能描述
## 修改点
## 日志控制
## SystemProperties
## 字符串国际化
## 可回滚性
```

Recommended additional headings:

```markdown
## 验证方式
## 风险说明
```

## Log And Property Checks

- New direct `Log.*` and `Slog.*` calls are forbidden.
- Use `FrameworkLog`.
- `persist.sys.framework.debug.*` must be centralized in `FrameworkLog.java`.
- User-visible strings should use resources and include Chinese/English values.

## Patch Read Models

Each generated `framework_change` package must include:

- `materials/display/patch_view.json`: human-facing material model for member/admin UI. Main display fields must be a human title, problem, solution, result, risk/gap, project, platform, and Android version.
- `materials/evidence/patch_ai_facts.json`: AI/admin evidence model for validation, curation review, search indexing, and merge judgement. It must include concrete module, feature domain, patch behavior goal, code anchors, patch assets, verification targets, search usage, search match class, merge gate inputs, protocol version, and plugin version.

`patch_view` is not a second fact source. It is the human-readable view of the same package. `patch_ai_facts` is not UI copy. It exists so management-side curation does not infer merge/new-case decisions from titles, filenames, or weak search hits.
