# Daily Work Facts Contract

Use this contract only when authorized development evidence cannot resolve a
daily work scope, when the inferred scope needs correction, when explicit key
points or dependencies must be preserved, or when the member explicitly
overrides it. Normal high-confidence Patch/App/GMS/Doc/Other inference with no
explicit attention facts does not require this file. Write it under:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/artifacts/android-knowledge-intake/daily-facts/<report-date>.json
```

Do not write runtime facts into the plugin source, skill, or plugin-cache directory.

Rules:

- `report_date` must equal the generated daily date.
- `projects[]`, `documents[]`, and `standalone_work[]` describe today's actual
  work; at least one must be non-empty. A plan alone cannot replace a daily
  work record.
- In `projects[]`, `project` and direct `customer` are required. Optional
  `downstream_customer` means the direct customer's customer. `customer`
  contains only the direct customer. Do not flatten a two-level chain into one
  whitespace-separated `customer` value; local validation rejects it until the
  two fields are separated.
- Project `work_type` is `Patch`, `App`, `GMS`, `Doc`, or `Other`. The five visible categories
  are `Patch`, `App`, `GMS`, `Doc`, and `Other`.
  Explicit facts override automatic inference. Never infer from vague work-item
  wording alone.
- `App` requires `app_name`; other project types must not provide it.
- A current GMS row requires `gms_release_type` (`IR`, `MR`, `SMR`, `ESMR`,
  `EMR`, or `LR`) and an Android major-version `gms_target` written as
  `A<digits>` (for example `A14`). It also records cycle status,
  current stage, cumulative self-test round/result, and cumulative formal
  submission count/result. Self-test rounds and submissions are independent:
  several self-test rounds may lead to the first submission, and that first
  submission may pass. Entering `submission` requires the latest self-test
  result to be `passed`; a returned submission goes back to `self_test`.
  Problems and fixes remain ordinary `work_items[]`; do not create a separate
  processing-cycle or issue subsystem.
- In `documents[]`, `work_type` is only `Doc` and a concrete `document_name` is
  required. In `standalone_work[]`, `work_type` is only `Other` and a concrete
  `work_name` is required. Neither array carries project/customer/App fields.
  GMS is always project-bound. Historical `Document` normalizes to `Doc`.
  Do not use “文档” as a fake company project code.
- Scope identity is project/customer + work type; App additionally includes its
  name, and GMS additionally includes release type + target. The same project
  may therefore carry separate IR, MR, or SMR scopes without merging them.
- Every scope carries `key_points[]` and `dependencies[]`. Both fields are
  arrays and may be empty. `key_points` records explicit external project news,
  scope changes, or a key difficulty overcome today. `dependencies` records
  explicit external dependencies or coordination needs. Do not infer either
  field merely because work is unfinished.
- Document scope identity is its concrete document name. Merge repeated work on
  the same document instead of creating duplicate rows.
- When a project has only one scope, `work_items`, `today_topic`, and
  `current_result` may be omitted; the generator fills them from the authorized
  session-derived daily work.
- When the same project has multiple scopes, each scope must explicitly carry
  its own `work_items[]` so work cannot be assigned to the wrong Patch or App.
- Every work item contains `name`, non-empty `did[]`, non-empty `how[]`,
  `result`, and `status`. Status is exactly `已完成`, `处理中`, `待验证`, or
  `阻塞`.
- `tomorrow_plan` is required and contains parallel `projects[]`, `documents[]`,
  and `standalone_work[]` arrays. These arrays may all be empty.
- Every tomorrow-plan row has a non-empty `plan_items[]`. Project plans use the
  same project/customer/work-type identity rules as today; Doc and Other plans
  use the same non-project name rules. A plan does not need a matching today
  scope.
- A GMS tomorrow-plan row includes only `gms_release_type` and `gms_target`
  beside its ordinary project identity and `plan_items[]`. It does not claim a
  cycle status, stage, self-test round, or submission count before work occurs.
- Tomorrow-plan rows must not contain `today_topic`, `current_result`,
  `work_items`, `key_points`, `dependencies`, `tomorrow_focus`, or `status`.
  Likewise, current v4 today rows must not contain `tomorrow_focus`.
- Do not derive plans automatically from an unfinished status. “尚未开始，明日
  执行” belongs only in `tomorrow_plan`; it must never be represented as a
  completed, in-progress, or otherwise fabricated today work item.
- Codex writes this JSON from the current development evidence and only asks the
  member for facts that remain ambiguous. Do not ask the member to hand-edit
  JSON, Markdown, or `report_view.json`.
- Markdown and `report_view.json` are regenerated from the normalized object.
  Editing only one representation invalidates the render binding and blocks
  submission.
