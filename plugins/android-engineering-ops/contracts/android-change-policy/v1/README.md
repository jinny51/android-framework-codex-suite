# Android Change Policy v1

`policy.json` is the canonical, machine-readable policy. This README explains the
boundary; it does not define a second copy of the rules.

The policy has three layers:

1. Patch attribution applies to every Android change archived as patches.
2. Framework logging, debug-property, resource, and feature-material rules apply only
   when `component.layer=platform` and `component.type=framework`. The legacy
   `change_domain=framework` route first normalizes to that component; it is not a new
   domain authority.
3. Historical Jinny helper-name and utility-class suffix conventions remain available
   only as a compatibility advisory. They are not universal Android engineering rules.

For new Codex-authored source, Codex resolves `member_alias` from the current member
profile and creates paired markers while implementing the change:

```text
//<member_alias> <yyyyMMdd>@{
...
//<member_alias> <yyyyMMdd>@}
```

Markers are standalone slash-comment lines. For current Codex changes, every nonblank
added line in an applicable file/hunk is inside a matching pair; pairs never cross a
file or diff hunk. Context, blank lines, explicit generated output, and file types
without the slash-comment adapter are outside this check.

`--profile` may select an existing profile, and a configured default profile may be
used. There is deliberately no free-form alias argument or environment-variable alias
override: the selected profile's `member_alias` is the identity.

Even a one-line custom change uses the pair. This exact `//` form applies only where
slash line comments are valid; XML, shell, properties, and other syntaxes must not be
broken by blindly inserting it. A future comment-style adapter must preserve the same
identity/date/pairing semantics before those files receive direct markers.

No example person's alias is a policy value. Git author, an invented secondary alias,
or a fabricated ticket number must not replace the current profile identity.
Historical and external patches keep their original authorship and are assessed as
imported material instead of being rewritten.
