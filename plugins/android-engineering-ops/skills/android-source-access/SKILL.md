# Android Source Access

Use this single public Skill for WSL/CIFS and macOS/SMB source access. The implementation
is owned by `android-engineering-ops`; no host plugin is required.

## Active Install Family

Pure `--help`, host detection, and command listing may run without an installed-family
receipt. Before an adapter reads credentials/registry state or performs any network,
mount, registration, or filesystem action, set `PLUGIN_ROOT` to the directory two
levels above this `SKILL.md` and run:

```bash
python3 "$PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/android_engineering_ops/install_family.py" \
  --plugin-root "$PLUGIN_ROOT"
```

A nonzero result is a hard stop. Do not use a source checkout, a mixed legacy/target
installation, or a worker assertion as a substitute for this target-only receipt.

Always detect the real local host before selecting a command:

```bash
python3 "scripts/android_source_access.py" detect
python3 "scripts/android_source_access.py" list-commands
```

The dispatcher recognizes WSL only from WSL environment/kernel evidence and recognizes
macOS only from `platform.system() == Darwin`. Plain Linux and unknown systems fail
closed before an adapter command runs. A host-specific command invoked on the other host
also fails before side effects.

Use either the dispatcher or the stable command names in `scripts/`:

```bash
python3 "scripts/android_source_access.py" run mount-from-remote-path.sh -- \
  --remote-root /home/<remote-user>/work/<platform>/<project>
```

## Stable state

Read and update the existing identities in place:

- WSL and shared registry: `$HOME/.servers/projects`, `$HOME/.servers/credentials`
- macOS credentials: existing Keychain service identities
- human source and artifact bridge: `$HOME/work/<platform>/<project>`

Never copy, rename, or rewrite credentials as part of plugin migration. The mount is for
human CRUD and verified artifact delivery only. Every Codex source read, edit, Git/repo
operation, checkpoint, capture, or build on a registered remote tree goes through
`android-remote-channel`.

For WSL recognition and recovery detail, read `references/design.md` and
`references/manual-recovery.md`. For macOS registry, Keychain, mount, and restore detail,
read `references/macos-source-access.md`.
