# Android Source CIFS Mount Design

Use this as the design baseline before changing scripts. The goal is a predictable mount agent, not a clever guessing agent.

## User Contract

Treat a user-provided remote path as an Android SDK source root. Do not use its
parent folder names or final basename to decide the platform or project name.

Common request:

```text
把/home/test55/work/unisoc/rk3576挂载一下，密码123
```

Extract:

- `remote_root=/home/test55/work/unisoc/rk3576`
- `remote_user=test55`
- bare password `123` as a runtime fallback for missing typed passwords; each role tries explicit typed password, then saved typed password, then the runtime fallback
- optional explicit platform or project overrides only when the user states them

## Non-Expansion Rules

Do not fan out when required connection facts are missing.

- If the user provides `ip192.168.x.x`, use `<remote_user>@IP` first.
- Otherwise read WSL and Windows SSH config only.
- If no usable SSH HostName/IP is found, stop and ask for the server IP.
- Do not rely on system DNS for names like `test55`.
- Do not scan networks, guess hosts, or try unrelated aliases.
- If a password is needed and no user-provided or saved password is available, stop and ask for that role's password.
- Do not try empty passwords, common passwords, or unrelated historical passwords.

## Decision Order

### Platform

Use this priority:

1. User-stated platform, such as `rk平台`.
2. Source-tree evidence from the remote SDK root.
3. If neither user input nor source-tree evidence gives a platform, stop and ask.

If user-stated platform conflicts with source-tree evidence, stop and ask which
platform to use. Do not silently prefer either side. After the user confirms,
continue only with an explicit acceptance flag such as
`--accept-platform-conflict`.

High-signal source evidence:

```text
rk     -> device/rockchip, vendor/rockchip, hardware/rockchip, TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM=rk*
unisoc -> device/sprd, vendor/sprd, vendor/unisoc, hardware/sprd, ums/uis/sc/shark/qogir/pike platforms
mtk    -> device/mediatek, vendor/mediatek, device/mtk, vendor/mtk, TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM=mt*
```

Even if the path contains another platform name, ignore that path segment for
the platform decision.

### SDK/Project Name

Use this priority:

1. User-stated project name.
2. Key repository branch names.
3. Project-level marker such as `BRANCH_BUILDTYPE`.
4. If neither user input nor source-tree evidence gives a project name, stop and ask.

If user-stated project name conflicts with source-tree evidence, stop and ask
which project name to use. Do not silently prefer either side. After the user
confirms, continue only with an explicit acceptance flag such as
`--accept-sdk-name-conflict`.

Prefer branches from:

```text
frameworks/base
device/<vendor>/<soc>
vendor/<vendor>/common
kernel
u-boot
```

Ignore generic branch names such as `master`, `main`, `develop`, `release`, `stable`, `HEAD`, and Android tag branches. Treat Android `PRODUCT_NAME`, lunch targets, and `TARGET_PRODUCT` as build product diagnostics, not business project names.

Example:

```text
remote_root=/home/test55/work/unisoc/rk3576
source evidence: device/rockchip + TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM=rk3576
frameworks/base branch: TVA10A2R
platform=rk
sdk_name=TVA10A2R
local_project=/home/<wsl-user>/work/rk/TVA10A2R
```

## First-Time Mount Pipeline

Keep the pipeline linear:

1. Parse user input into `remote_root`, optional IP, optional platform/project overrides, optional server-side password defaults, optional local WSL sudo password, and optional role-specific password overrides.
2. Plan only path-derived connection basics: `remote_user`, initial `SSH_HOST`, and `remote_root`.
3. Resolve SSH candidates from explicit IP or SSH config. Stop if no IP/HostName is available.
4. Choose a reachable SSH candidate by checking the remote SDK root exists.
5. Inspect the remote SDK root to infer platform and project name.
6. If platform or project name is still missing, stop and ask for the missing value.
7. Build the final local path: `/home/<wsl-user>/work/<platform>/<sdk_name>`.
8. Use project-level mounting by default: mount the remote SDK root to `/home/<wsl-user>/work/<platform>/<sdk_name>`.
9. Discover an existing Samba share covering the remote SDK root.
10. If missing, create a project-level Samba share for the remote SDK root. Parent/platform shares are explicit exceptions only.
11. Before mounting, verify the local platform directory is not itself a mount point and the exact target directory is empty or absent. Refuse to mount over non-empty directories.
12. Mount, verify Android markers, remember recovery metadata, and hand off to build/deploy work.

## Credential Scope

Keep remote account secrets and local WSL secrets scoped separately.

- Account-level password files are keyed by Samba user and server. They store server facts and server-side typed passwords: SSH bootstrap, Samba, and remote sudo.
- The local WSL sudo fallback password belongs to the current WSL user, not to any remote server. Store it once at `credentials/local-sudo.env`.
- Explicit `WSL密码...`, `本机密码...`, or `本地sudo密码...` targets `local-sudo.env`; explicit `服务器密码...` or `远端密码...` targets the remote account's SSH/Samba/remote-sudo typed passwords for this run.
- A bare `密码...` is a runtime fallback, not a persisted server field. Each role resolves explicit typed password, then saved typed password, then the runtime fallback.
- If the runtime fallback succeeds for a role, save it as that role's typed password. Runtime bare passwords may be used for local sudo only when no saved local sudo password exists.
- A role counts as succeeded only when the workflow observes role-specific evidence: `SSH_KEY_INSTALLED` for SSH password bootstrap, `SAMBA_AUTH mode=password` after a CIFS mount for Samba, `REMOTE_SUDO_AUTH mode=password` during Samba auto-config for remote sudo, and `LOCAL_SUDO_AUTH mode=password` during local CIFS mount setup for WSL sudo.
- Restore and mount flows may read account-level `SAVED_LOCAL_SUDO_PASSWORD` values from `.passwords.env` files; new writes use only `local-sudo.env`.

## Module Boundaries

- `plan-from-remote-path.sh`: parse only connection basics such as `remote_user`, `SSH_HOST`, and `remote_root`; never infer platform or project name from path segments.
- `resolve-ssh-candidate.sh`: resolve and rank SSH targets from explicit IP or SSH configs; do not use DNS guessing as a fallback.
- `inspect-android-sdk.*`: inspect the remote SDK root and produce authoritative `PLATFORM`, `SDK_NAME`, `PROJECT_BRANCH`, `ANDROID_PRODUCT_NAME`, and `TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM`; return `PLATFORM_REQUIRED` or `SDK_NAME_REQUIRED` instead of using path fallback, return `PLATFORM_CONFLICT` or `SDK_NAME_CONFLICT` when explicit user input disagrees with source evidence, and proceed through conflicts only with explicit user-confirmation flags.
- `mount-from-remote-path.sh`: orchestrate the pipeline; keep recognition rules out of this script.
- `discover-samba-share.sh`: map a remote root to an existing Samba URL.
- `ensure-samba-share.sh`: create or validate Samba shares. Prefer project-level shares for SDK-root mounting; parent/platform shares are explicit exceptions only.
- `mount-platform.sh`: perform CIFS mount and local sudo handling.
- `restore-project-mount.sh`: list, remember, and restore exact project mounts.

## Refactor Direction

Prefer keeping mount/sudo/SSH orchestration in shell. Move parsing-heavy recognition into Python when it grows beyond simple checks.

Good Python candidates:

- source-tree platform scoring
- key repository branch collection
- manifest and product file parsing
- structured output validation

Keep shell for:

- `ssh`
- `sudo`
- `mount.cifs`
- `findmnt`
- small env-file orchestration
